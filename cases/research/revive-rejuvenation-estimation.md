# REVIVE - Rejuvenation Estimation Via Insightful Virtual Experiments

## Description

REVIVE is the first computational platform designed for systematically predicting chemical and genetic perturbations capable of restoring youthful transcriptional states based on gene expression data. The platform uses age predictions to detect significant rejuvenating effects and quantitatively assesses the impact of perturbations on aging hallmarks.

## Mission

To develop a computational platform for systematically predicting chemical and genetic perturbations capable of restoring youthful transcriptional states based on gene expression data. REVIVE aims to accelerate the discovery of rejuvenation strategies that counteract age-related functional decline and improve cellular functions in humans by enabling systematic in silico screening of potential interventions.

## Project Information

**Start Date**: 2024
**Publication Date**: 2025-11-25
**Objectives**: To develop a computational platform for systematically predicting chemical and genetic perturbations capable of restoring youthful transcriptional states based on gene expression data. REVIVE aims to accelerate the discovery of rejuvenation strategies that counteract age-related functional decline and improve cellular functions in humans by enabling systematic in silico screening of potential interventions.
**Methodology**: REVIVE uses gene expression data to predict cellular and tissue age. The platform evaluates the impact of chemical and genetic perturbations on transcriptional profiles, determining which ones can restore a youthful state. REVIVE also quantitatively assesses the impact of these perturbations on aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, DNA damage, and inflammation.
**Results**: REVIVE identified 742 rejuvenating perturbations (477 novel compounds + 329 conditions) capable of restoring youthful transcriptional states. The platform was validated against 80 gold-standard aging interventions with 80% accuracy, and showed significant enrichment compared to known longevity compounds in the DrugAge database.
**Collaboration Period**: 2024-present

## Scientific Background

```yaml
ai_necessity: "AI is essential because: (1) Determining 'rejuvenation' requires analyzing high-dimensional transcriptomic shifts that standard differential expression misses, (2) Can distinguish true rejuvenation from stress responses, (3) Enables systematic screening of perturbagens in silico."
biological_bottleneck: Distinguishing between interventions that merely change cell state vs. those that genuinely restore youthful transcriptional identity. Standard differential expression misses high-dimensional transcriptomic shifts.
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- First computational framework for systematic prediction of rejuvenating perturbations from transcriptomics
- Successfully identified 477 novel compounds with rejuvenating potential
- Validated against 80 gold-standard interventions with 80% accuracy
- Systematic analysis across 12 aging hallmarks simultaneously

### Challenges

- Distinguishing true rejuvenation from stress responses requires sophisticated AI methods
- High-dimensional transcriptomic shifts cannot be captured by standard differential expression

### Impact on Field

REVIVE establishes a new paradigm for systematic discovery of rejuvenating interventions, moving beyond expert-driven approaches to data-driven computational screening.

**Type**: platform
**Status**: operational
**Development Stage**: Research / Preclinical
**Role in Project**: primary
**Description**: REVIVE is the first computational platform designed for systematically predicting chemical and genetic perturbations capable of restoring youthful transcriptional states based on gene expression data.

  ai_methods:
  - Generalized Linear Models
  - Lasso Regularization
  - Transcriptional Aging Clock
  - Perturbation Signature Mapping
  workflow_modes:
  -
  mode: Rejuvenation Effect Assessment
  description: Based on a set of transcriptomic samples from perturbation experiments and corresponding control samples, REVIVE assesses the change in predicted age and enrichment of aging hallmarks in both groups. Perturbations that show significant reduction in predicted age and restore at least one aging hallmark are considered capable of restoring a more youthful transcriptional state.
  -
  mode: Perturbation Repurposing
  description: For repurposing perturbations to restore youthful transcriptional states, REVIVE requires a set of differentially expressed genes between young and old cells or tissue samples and ranks perturbations based on their potential to reverse the expression of observed differentially expressed genes.
  technical_approach: REVIVE uses gene expression data to predict cellular and tissue age. The platform evaluates the impact of chemical and genetic perturbations on transcriptional profiles, determining which ones can restore a youthful state. REVIVE also quantitatively assesses the impact of these perturbations on aging hallmarks such as cellular senescence, DNA damage, and inflammation.
