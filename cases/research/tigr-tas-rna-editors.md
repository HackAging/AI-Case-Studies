# TIGR-Tas: A family of modular RNA-guided DNA-targeting systems

## Description

Discovery and characterization of TIGR-Tas (Tandem Interspaced Guide RNA-associated proteins) systems - a family of compact, modular RNA-guided DNA-targeting systems discovered in prokaryotes and their viruses. These systems represent a new class of programmable editing tools that are significantly smaller than Cas9 and do not require PAM sequences for targeting.

## Mission

TIGR-Tas systems address a critical bottleneck in aging research: safe in vivo delivery for gene/cell therapies in aging tissues. Traditional editors are too large for constrained delivery vectors. The compact size and PAM-free nature of TIGR-Tas enable delivery-friendly programmable editing, potentially enabling qualitatively new rejuvenation experiments with precise edits that fit into tighter delivery vectors.

## Project Information

**Publication Date**: 2025-02-27

## Scientific Background

```yaml
discovery_method: Large-scale computational mining and structural modeling, starting with analysis of RNA-binding domain structure of SpCas9. Proteins containing Nop domains characteristic of eukaryotic box C/D snoRNA ribonucleoproteins were found associated with characteristic arrays of guide RNAs with tandem intervals.
historical_context:
  crispr_timeline:
  1987: CRISPR sequences first discovered in bacteria
  2005: CRISPR identified as adaptive immune system
  2012: CRISPR-Cas9 developed as genome editing tool (Doudna, Charpentier, Zhang labs)
  2020: CRISPR-Cas9 approved for clinical use (first therapeutic applications)
  2025: TIGR-Tas discovered as new class of compact, PAM-free RNA-guided editors
  rna_guided_systems_evolution: The discovery of TIGR-Tas expands the known diversity of RNA-guided DNA-targeting systems, revealing evolutionary connections between prokaryotic defense systems, eukaryotic RNA processing machinery (box C/D snoRNPs), and mobile genetic elements (IS110 transposases).
mechanism_insights:
  modularity: The modular structure of Tas proteins (Nop domain + optional nuclease domains) allows for engineering different functionalities, making them adaptable for various applications.
  dual_spacer_mechanism: Unlike CRISPR systems that use a single guide RNA to target one DNA strand, TIGR systems employ a tandem spacer targeting mechanism where spacer A binds to one DNA strand and spacer B binds to the complementary DNA strand, with both spacers requiring proper pairing for effective cleavage.
  specificity_advantage: The requirement for both spacers to correctly pair with complementary DNA strands may provide higher specificity compared to single-guide systems, as it requires recognition of both DNA strands.
connection_to_fanzor:
  researcher_continuity: Guilhem Faure, the lead researcher on TIGR-Tas, also discovered Fanzor proteins - the first programmable RNA-guided endonucleases found in eukaryotes. This demonstrates a research trajectory focused on discovering novel RNA-guided editing systems across different domains of life.
  evolutionary_relationship: Both Fanzor and TIGR-Tas represent discoveries of new classes of RNA-guided systems, expanding beyond the CRISPR-Cas paradigm and revealing the broader diversity of programmable genome editing tools in nature.
natural_distribution:
  scale: Over 20,000 different Tas proteins identified
  organisms: TIGR-Tas systems are found in prokaryotes and their viruses
  predominant_location: Predominantly found in viruses infecting bacteria (bacteriophages)
  biological_significance: The high prevalence in bacteriophages suggests TIGR-Tas may be involved in viral defense mechanisms, genetic element competition, or regulation of mobile genetic elements
evolutionary_insights:
  natural_selection: The prevalence of TIGR-Tas systems in bacteriophages suggests they may play roles in viral defense, genetic element competition, or plasmid maintenance in prokaryotic ecosystems.
  functional_diversity: The discovery expands our understanding of the diversity of RNA-guided DNA-targeting mechanisms in nature, revealing that compact, efficient systems exist beyond the well-studied CRISPR-Cas families.
  structural_connections: TIGR-Tas systems show structural similarity to box C/D snoRNPs and IS110 RNA-guided transposases, providing insights into the evolution of different RNA-guided systems. This suggests convergent evolution or shared ancestry between diverse RNA-guided mechanisms.
```

## Lessons Learned

### Impact on Field

TIGR-Tas represents a significant advancement in genome editing technology, offering a new class of compact, PAM-free editing tools that address critical delivery constraints. The discovery expands the toolkit available for therapeutic genome editing and opens new possibilities for in vivo gene therapy applications, particularly in aging research where delivery constraints are a primary barrier.
