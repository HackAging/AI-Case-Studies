# Translational Pressure Test for Senolytics in Human Neuronal Models

## Description

A translational pressure test framework that uses advanced analytic pipelines to evaluate translatability barriers of common senolytics in human neurons. The framework addresses the critical problem that senolytics that work in mice often fail in humans due to species differences. It enables early de-risking of senolytic portfolios and redirects them toward cell-type-specific strategies.

## Mission

To develop a translational pressure test framework that systematically evaluates translatability barriers of senolytics in human neuronal models, enabling early de-risking of senolytic portfolios and redirection toward cell-type-specific strategies.

## Project Information

**Publication Date**: 2025

## Scientific Background

```yaml
advanced_analytics:
  description: AI-powered advanced analytic pipelines enable systematic evaluation of translatability barriers
  capabilities:
  - Systematic barrier identification
  - Human-specific response modeling
  - Early risk assessment
  - Portfolio optimization
senolytics_concept:
  importance: Senolytics hold promise for treating age-related diseases, but translation from mouse to human has been challenging
  description: Senolytics are compounds that selectively eliminate senescent cells, which accumulate with age and contribute to age-related diseases including neurodegenerative disorders
human_neuron_models:
  advantages:
  - Human-specific responses
  - Mature, synaptically active neurons
  - Ability to model neurodegenerative diseases
  - Evaluation independent of BBB permeability
  description: Primary human neurons and astrocytes cultured to mature stages provide more physiologically relevant models than mouse models
translation_problem:
  impact: This has led to failures in clinical trials and wasted resources
  solution: Human neuron models provide more relevant assessment of translatability
  description: Mouse-to-human translation is weak. Senolytics that work in mice often fail in humans due to species differences in cellular responses, metabolism, and biology
alzheimer_disease_context:
  challenge: However, senolytics must be safe for neurons, which are post-mitotic and cannot be replaced
  importance: This makes human neuron models critical for safety assessment
  description: "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by accumulation of senescent cells, making it a prime target for senolytic therapy"
