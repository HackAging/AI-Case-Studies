# InfoSEM and scKAN Project

## Description

Development of advanced methods for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from gene expression data, using informative priors (InfoSEM) and explainable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (scKAN)

## Mission

To develop advanced methods for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from gene expression data. InfoSEM focuses on using informative priors (text embeddings of genes) to improve GRN inference without requiring expensive ground truth labels, while scKAN applies explainable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to accurately identify activation and inhibition regulations from single-cell RNA-seq data. Both approaches aim to overcome limitations of traditional supervised models and provide more accurate, interpretable GRN inference methods.

## Project Information


## Scientific Background

```yaml
kan_approach: "scKAN uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with explainable AI to model gene expression as differentiable functions. This approach captures the smooth nature of cellular dynamics and enables accurate identification of activation and inhibition regulations, providing interpretable insights into gene regulatory mechanisms. KANs are particularly well-suited for biological applications because: (1) They model smooth, continuous processes that match cellular dynamics, (2) The learnable functions on edges are interpretable, (3) They can capture complex non-linear relationships while maintaining explainability."
explainability: "Both approaches emphasize interpretability: InfoSEM through informative priors that can be understood and validated, and scKAN through explainable AI and geometric tools that provide insights into regulatory mechanisms. Explainability is crucial for biological applications because: (1) Researchers need to understand why the model makes certain predictions, (2) Regulatory relationships must be biologically plausible, (3) Models should provide insights that can guide experimental validation, (4) Interpretability enables trust and adoption in biological research."
single_cell_analysis: "Single-cell RNA-seq data provides unprecedented resolution for studying cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics. scKAN leverages this high-dimensional data to infer signed GRN, identifying both activating and inhibitory regulatory relationships. Single-cell data presents unique challenges: (1) High dimensionality (thousands of genes), (2) Sparsity (many zero counts), (3) Noise (technical and biological variability), (4) Need to capture cell-to-cell variation. scKAN's differentiable function approach is well-suited to handle these challenges while maintaining interpretability."
grn_inference_mechanism: "Gene regulatory networks (GRN) represent the complex interactions between genes and their regulators. Inferring GRN from gene expression data is a fundamental problem in computational biology, with applications in understanding disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Traditional methods face challenges including: (1) Need for expensive ground truth labels, (2) Gene-specific biases in supervised models, (3) Difficulty in identifying signed regulations (activation vs inhibition), (4) Limited interpretability of deep learning models."
complementary_approaches: "InfoSEM and scKAN are complementary: InfoSEM focuses on using prior knowledge (text embeddings) to improve inference without labels, while scKAN focuses on explainable modeling of single-cell dynamics. InfoSEM works well when text information about genes is available, while scKAN excels at capturing continuous cellular processes. Both address limitations of traditional methods but from different angles."
informative_priors_approach: InfoSEM uses text embeddings of genes as informative priors in an unsupervised generative model. This approach allows the model to leverage prior knowledge about genes without requiring expensive ground truth labels, while avoiding gene-specific biases that can affect supervised models. Text embeddings capture semantic information about genes (function, pathways, interactions) that can guide GRN inference. This is particularly valuable for genes with limited experimental data, as the embeddings provide biological context that helps the model make informed predictions.
comparison_with_traditional_methods: "Traditional GRN inference methods include: (1) Correlation-based methods (simple but limited), (2) Mutual information methods (capture non-linear relationships but computationally expensive), (3) Regression-based methods (require assumptions about relationships), (4) Deep learning methods (powerful but often black-box). InfoSEM improves upon these by using informative priors to guide inference without requiring labels. scKAN improves upon these by using explainable KAN architecture that captures smooth dynamics and provides interpretability."
```

  peer_review: Not yet peer-reviewed (preprint)
  publication_date: June 16, 2025
  validation_status: Preprint published
methodology: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with explainable AI
explainability: Explainable AI and geometric tools
data_processing: scRNA-seq data is processed to handle sparsity and noise inherent in single-cell measurements. The model likely includes preprocessing steps for normalization, imputation, and quality control.
kan_architecture: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) are a novel neural network architecture that replaces linear weights with learnable functions on edges. Unlike traditional MLPs that use fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs use learnable univariate functions on edges, making them more interpretable and potentially more expressive for modeling smooth biological processes.
regulation_types: Identifies activation and inhibition regulations
training_process: The model is trained on single-cell RNA-seq data to learn gene expression functions. The training process optimizes the learnable functions on edges to best capture the relationships between genes while maintaining smoothness and interpretability.
cellular_dynamics: Captures smooth nature of cellular dynamics
modeling_approach: Differentiable functions for gene expression
architecture_details: KAN architecture consists of layers where each edge has a learnable univariate function (typically represented as splines or other smooth functions). This allows the network to learn complex, smooth functions that better match the continuous nature of cellular dynamics compared to piecewise-linear activations in traditional networks.
baseline_comparisons:
  signed_grn_methods: "Specifically compared against methods that infer signed GRN (directionality of regulation). scKAN's differentiable function approach enables more accurate identification of activation vs inhibition."
  deep_learning_methods: "Compared against deep learning-based GRN inference methods. scKAN's KAN architecture with explainable AI provides advantages in both performance and interpretability."
  traditional_grn_methods: Compared against traditional GRN inference methods (e.g., correlation-based, mutual information, regression-based). scKAN outperforms these by 5.40%–28.37% in AUROC and 1.97%–40.45% in AUPRC.
signed_grn_inference: The model infers signed GRN, meaning it identifies not just whether genes are connected, but also the direction (activation vs inhibition) and strength of regulatory relationships. The differentiable functions allow the model to determine the sign of regulation by analyzing the gradient of gene expression with respect to regulatory inputs.
smooth_dynamics_capture: "The KAN architecture's use of smooth, learnable functions naturally captures the continuous nature of cellular processes. Unlike discrete models, this allows the system to model gradual transitions in gene expression states and identify subtle regulatory relationships."
explainability_mechanism: KANs are inherently more interpretable than traditional neural networks because the learned functions on edges can be visualized and analyzed. The model uses geometric tools to analyze the learned functions and provide insights into regulatory mechanisms. This explainability is crucial for biological interpretation and validation.
gene_expression_modeling: Gene expression is modeled as differentiable functions of regulatory inputs. This approach captures the smooth, continuous nature of cellular dynamics, where gene expression changes gradually rather than in discrete steps. The differentiable nature allows the model to learn gradients and identify directionality of regulatory relationships.

**Alternative Names**: InfoSEM: Informative Priors for GRN Inference
**Type**: research_methodology
**Status**: Research phase - Published
**Development Stage**: Research / Preclinical
**Role in Project**: primary
**Relationship Description**: InfoSEM is one of the primary research methodologies developed in this project - an unsupervised deep generative model for GRN inference using informative priors (text embeddings)
**Description**: Unsupervised deep generative model for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from gene expression data.

When labels are available, the model can integrate them as additional priors, avoiding bias and improving performance.
**Mechanism of Action**: Unsupervised deep generative model for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from gene expression data. The process works as follows: (1) Gene names and descriptions are converted to text embeddings using language models, (2) These embeddings serve as informative priors in a deep generative model, (3) The model learns the joint distribution of gene expression patterns while incorporating prior knowledge from text embeddings, (4) GRN relationships are inferred from the learned distribution, (5) When ground truth labels are available, they can be integrated as additional priors without introducing bias.
**Target**: Gene regulatory networks (GRN)

  validation_status: Published and peer-reviewed at ICML 2025
methodology: Deep generative model with informative priors
supervision: Unsupervised (can integrate labels when available)
bias_handling: Avoids gene-specific biases
prior_integration: Text embeddings are integrated as informative priors in the generative model, providing biological knowledge without requiring expensive ground truth labels. When labels are available, they can be integrated as additional priors to further improve performance.
training_approach: The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on gene expression data, using text embeddings as priors. When ground truth labels are available, they can be incorporated as additional priors, allowing the model to leverage both semantic information (from text) and known regulatory relationships (from labels) without introducing bias.
generative_process: The model generates gene expression patterns that are consistent with both the observed data and the informative priors. This allows it to infer regulatory relationships even for genes with limited experimental data.
model_architecture: Deep generative model (likely VAE or similar architecture) that learns the joint distribution of gene expression patterns. The model incorporates informative priors derived from text embeddings of gene names and descriptions.
baseline_comparisons:
  generative_methods: "Compared against other generative models for GRN inference. InfoSEM's integration of text embeddings as priors distinguishes it from standard generative approaches."
  supervised_methods: Compared against supervised GRN inference methods that require ground truth labels. InfoSEM outperforms these by 38.5% when using text embeddings alone, demonstrating that informative priors can compensate for lack of labels.
  unsupervised_methods: "Compared against unsupervised methods that don't use priors. InfoSEM's use of informative priors provides significant advantage."
text_embedding_source: Text embeddings are likely generated from gene names, descriptions, and functional annotations using language models (e.g., BERT, GPT embeddings, or specialized biomedical language models). These embeddings capture semantic information about genes that can guide GRN inference.
bias_elimination_mechanism: "Traditional supervised models may be biased toward genes that are well-studied or have more available labels. InfoSEM avoids this by using text embeddings as priors, which provide information about all genes regardless of whether they have labels. This ensures that the model doesn't favor certain genes over others based on data availability."
