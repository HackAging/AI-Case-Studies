# Dignity-Aware AI for Elderly Monitoring

## Description

A position paper proposing next-generation elderly monitoring systems that move beyond simple fall detection to comprehensive Activity of Daily Living (ADL) recognition. The approach emphasizes dignity-preserving, privacy-aware monitoring using federated learning and edge AI deployment.

## Mission

Develop dignity-aware AI systems for comprehensive elderly monitoring that preserve privacy through federated learning and edge AI, moving beyond simple fall detection to holistic Activity of Daily Living recognition

## Project Information

**Publication Date**: 2025-11
**Objectives**: Propose next-generation elderly monitoring systems that move beyond simple fall detection to comprehensive Activity of Daily Living (ADL) recognition while preserving privacy and dignity

## Impact Metrics


## Scientific Background

```yaml
edge_ai_relevance:
  benefits:
  - Reduces latency for real-time monitoring
  - Eliminates cloud dependency
  - Improves privacy by keeping data local
  - Enables offline operation
  application: Critical for real-time activity recognition and emergency response
  description: Edge AI processes data locally on devices rather than in the cloud
dignity_in_elderly_care:
  importance: Critical for user acceptance and ethical deployment of monitoring systems
  principles:
  - Respect for autonomy
  - Privacy preservation
  - Minimal invasiveness
  - User empowerment
  - Transparency
  description: Dignity-aware design ensures that monitoring systems respect autonomy, privacy, and personal dignity of elderly individuals
elderly_monitoring_evolution:
  limitations: Limited to fall detection, privacy concerns, cloud dependency
  next_generation: Comprehensive ADL recognition with privacy-preserving technologies
  first_generation: Simple fall detection systems using sensors or cameras
federated_learning_relevance:
  benefit: Preserves privacy while enabling model improvement through distributed learning
  application: Ideal for elderly monitoring where privacy is paramount
  description: Federated learning enables training AI models across multiple devices without centralizing sensitive personal data
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Proposed comprehensive ADL monitoring framework moving beyond simple fall detection
- Developed privacy-preserving approach using federated learning and edge AI
- Established dignity-aware design principles for elderly monitoring
- Demonstrated feasibility of real-time edge-based activity recognition
- Created scalable architecture for deployment across multiple homes

### Implications

- Federated learning and edge AI can enable privacy-preserving elderly monitoring at scale
- Comprehensive ADL recognition provides more actionable insights than fall detection alone
- Dignity-aware design is critical for user acceptance in elderly care technology
- Edge deployment reduces infrastructure costs while improving privacy and latency
- Multi-modal sensor fusion enhances activity recognition accuracy

### Challenges

- Edge device computational limitations may restrict model complexity
- Federated learning coordination complexity increases with number of participants
- User acceptance requires education and trust-building
- ADL recognition accuracy depends on sensor quality and placement
- Regulatory compliance varies by jurisdiction
- Integration with existing healthcare systems may be challenging

### Impact on Field

This position paper proposes a paradigm shift from simple fall detection to comprehensive, privacy-preserving ADL monitoring for elderly care. By combining federated learning, edge AI, and dignity-aware design principles, the approach addresses key limitations of existing systems: privacy concerns, cloud dependency, and limited monitoring scope. The proposed framework has potential to improve quality of life for elderly individuals while respecting their autonomy and dignity. The emphasis on privacy-preserving technologies makes the approach particularly relevant in the context of increasing concerns about data privacy and surveillance in healthcare.
