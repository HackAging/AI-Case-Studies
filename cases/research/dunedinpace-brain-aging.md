# DunedinPACE Brain Aging Model

## Description

A brain-specific aging clock that uses MRI neuroimaging data to assess the pace of biological aging. DunedinPACNI extends the original DunedinPACE epigenetic clock to brain imaging, allowing assessment of aging pace from a single brain MRI scan without requiring blood samples.

## Mission

To develop a non-invasive, MRI-based biomarker for measuring the pace of brain aging that can predict cognitive decline, dementia risk, and assess intervention effectiveness without requiring blood samples.

## Project Information

**Start Date**: 2022
**Objectives**: Develop a brain-specific aging clock using MRI data,Extend DunedinPACE to neuroimaging modality,Enable aging assessment without blood samples,Predict cognitive decline and dementia risk,Validate across multiple cohorts

## Impact Metrics


## Scientific Background

```yaml
dunedin_study_basis: "The Dunedin Study has tracked 19 biomarkers related to cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and other systems in participants at ages 26, 32, 38, and 45. The rate of decline in these biomarkers forms the basis for the 'Pace of Aging' measure."
clinical_significance: Higher pace of aging (faster aging) is associated with increased risk of age-related diseases, cognitive decline, dementia, physical frailty, and mortality.
pace_of_aging_concept: "Pace of aging refers to the rate at which an individual's biological systems decline over time, rather than their absolute biological age. This is measured by tracking changes in multiple biomarkers across time points."
epigenetic_translation: DunedinPACE translates the longitudinal Pace of Aging measure into an epigenetic biomarker using DNA methylation patterns, allowing assessment from a single blood sample.
neuroimaging_extension: DunedinPACNI extends this concept to brain imaging, using structural MRI measures to predict the same pace of aging score without requiring blood samples.
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- First brain-specific aging clock extending epigenetic aging measurement to neuroimaging
- Validated across multiple large cohorts (ADNI, UK Biobank, BrainLat)
- Demonstrated comparable accuracy to blood-based DunedinPACE
- Successfully predicts cognitive decline and dementia risk
- Enables retrospective analysis of existing MRI datasets

### Implications

- Opens new avenue for non-invasive aging assessment using standard clinical imaging
- Can leverage existing neuroimaging databases without requiring new blood samples
- Provides brain-specific aging measure complementing systemic aging biomarkers
- Enables early detection and intervention for brain aging
- Demonstrates feasibility of cross-modality aging clock development

### Challenges

- Higher cost compared to blood-based methods (MRI vs blood test)
- Requires access to MRI facilities and expertise
- Limited to brain-specific aging (doesn't capture systemic aging)
- Need for standardized MRI protocols across different scanners
- Computational requirements for MRI processing

### Impact on Field

DunedinPACNI represents a significant advancement in aging biomarker research by demonstrating that pace of aging can be reliably measured from brain imaging without blood samples. This expands the toolkit available for aging research and clinical assessment, particularly in settings where MRI data is readily available. The success of DunedinPACNI validates the concept of modality-agnostic aging clocks and may inspire similar developments for other imaging modalities or biological measurements.
