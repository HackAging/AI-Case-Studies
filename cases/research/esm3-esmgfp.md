## Scientific Background

```yaml
esm_model_evolution:
  esm1: "ESM1 was Meta AI's first protein language model, introduced around 2019-2020. It was trained on protein sequences to learn evolutionary patterns and predict protein properties."
  esm2: ESM2, released by Meta AI around 2022, was a larger and more capable protein language model with improved sequence understanding and structure prediction capabilities.
  esm3: ESM3 represents a major leap forward as a multimodal generative model that simultaneously processes sequence, structure, and function. Developed by EvolutionaryScale (spun out from Meta AI), it can generate novel proteins through evolutionary simulation.
protein_language_models: Protein language models are AI systems trained on large datasets of protein sequences to learn patterns of protein evolution and function. ESM3 represents a significant advancement by incorporating structure and function information alongside sequence data, enabling multimodal reasoning about proteins.
comparison_with_other_models:
  rosetta: Rosetta is a traditional computational protein design suite using physics-based methods. ESM3 represents an AI-driven alternative.
  alphafold: AlphaFold (DeepMind) focuses on protein structure prediction from sequence. ESM3 goes beyond prediction to generation and design.
  profluent: Profluent Bio also develops protein language models for protein design. Both companies represent the cutting edge of AI-driven protein design.
