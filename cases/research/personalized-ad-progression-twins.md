# Personalized AD Progression Digital Twins Project

## Description

Development of personalized digital twins for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression through spatiotemporal atrophy modeling using personalized graph dynamic models. Applied to 1,891 participants from ADNI with high accuracy in predicting key AD biomarkers.

## Mission

To develop personalized digital twins for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression through spatiotemporal atrophy modeling. The project aims to create individual models that can predict future changes in brain structure and cognitive function in AD patients. The personalized graph dynamic model tracks the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy using longitudinal MRI and PET data, building individualized brain graphs and learning the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. The goal is to provide a quantitative, personalized paradigm for predicting AD trajectories, with applications in patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapy development.

## Project Information


## Scientific Background

```yaml
graph_dynamic_model: The personalized graph dynamic model builds individualized brain graphs for each patient and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Graph-based modeling is well-suited for brain networks because brain regions are naturally connected, and neurodegeneration spreads through these connections.
biomarker_prediction: The model predicts key AD biomarkers including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognitive function. The relationship between biomarkers is complex, with amyloid-beta accumulation typically occurring early, followed by tau pathology and neurodegeneration.
digital_twins_approach: Digital twins are computational models that reflect individual patient characteristics and allow modeling of disease development and evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Personalized digital twins provide quantitative, personalized paradigms for predicting disease trajectories.
patient_stratification: By identifying different progression subtypes through patient-specific parameters, the model enables better patient stratification for clinical trials and personalized treatment planning. The personalized model identifies subtypes such as fast vs slow progressors and different spatial patterns.
spatiotemporal_modeling: The spatiotemporal atrophy model captures the spatial and temporal evolution of cortical atrophy, modeling how neurodegeneration spreads across brain regions over time. Spatiotemporal modeling is crucial for AD because atrophy spreads through connected brain regions with patient-specific patterns.
alzheimer_disease_mechanism: "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cortical atrophy, accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline. Neurodegeneration typically follows specific patterns, starting in temporolimbic regions and spreading to frontal and parietal regions, with significant individual variation."
comparison_with_traditional_methods: Traditional methods for AD progression prediction include clinical biomarkers, standard neuroimaging analysis, and population-level models. The personalized graph dynamic model improves upon these by modeling spatiotemporal dynamics explicitly, incorporating connectivity information, and personalizing for each patient.
```

**Mechanism of Action**: Personalized graph dynamic model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy using longitudinal MRI and PET data. The process works as follows: (1) Individualized brain graphs are constructed for each patient from their neuroimaging data, with nodes representing brain regions and edges representing connectivity, (2) Longitudinal data (multiple time points) is used to extract features (cortical thickness, volume, amyloid/tau levels) for each region, (3) A dynamic model learns how atrophy propagates through the graph over time, capturing both local changes and network effects, (4) Patient-specific parameters are learned that capture individual progression patterns and subtypes, (5) The model predicts future biomarker levels (amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration) and cognitive function by simulating the learned dynamics forward in time, (6) Sensitivity analysis identifies regional drivers of disease spread.

These features are used as node attributes in the graph.
dynamic_modeling: The model learns differential equations or neural network dynamics that describe how atrophy propagates across the brain graph over time. The dynamics capture both local changes (within regions) and network effects (how changes in one region affect connected regions). This spatiotemporal modeling allows prediction of future atrophy patterns.
learning_process: "The model learns patient-specific parameters that govern the dynamics of neurodegeneration. These parameters capture: (1) Baseline vulnerability of each region, (2) Rate of progression, (3) Connectivity-based spread patterns, (4) Individual differences in progression subtypes. The learning process uses longitudinal data to fit these parameters for each patient."

graph_construction: Individualized brain graphs for each patient

baseline_comparisons:
  population_models: "Compared against population-level models that don't account for individual differences. The personalized approach identifies progression subtypes and provides more accurate individual predictions."
  clinical_benchmarks: Compared against clinical prediction methods that use standard biomarkers (e.g., CSF amyloid-beta, tau levels). The personalized graph model outperforms these by capturing spatial patterns and network effects.
  neuroimaging_benchmarks: Compared against standard neuroimaging analysis methods (e.g., voxel-based morphometry, ROI-based analysis). The graph-based approach provides better prediction by modeling connectivity and spatiotemporal dynamics.

  - Neurodegeneration
  - Cognitive function
prediction_mechanism: "The graph dynamic model predicts biomarkers by: (1) Modeling how atrophy spreads through the brain network, (2) Relating structural changes to biomarker levels (amyloid-beta, tau), (3) Connecting neurodegeneration patterns to cognitive function, (4) Using patient-specific parameters to personalize predictions."
graph_construction_details: "Brain graphs are constructed from each patient's neuroimaging data (MRI, PET). Nodes typically represent brain regions (e.g., from anatomical atlases like AAL, Desikan-Killiany), and edges represent either structural connectivity (white matter tracts from DTI) or functional connectivity (correlations from fMRI). The graph structure captures the patient's unique brain architecture."
