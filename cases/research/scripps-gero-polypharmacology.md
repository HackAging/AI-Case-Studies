# Scripps Research & Gero AI Polypharmacology Platform

## Description

Research collaboration between Scripps Research (Petrascheck Lab) and Gero to develop an AI-driven polypharmacology platform for identifying compounds that target multiple aging-related pathways simultaneously. The platform uses graph neural networks to predict polypharmacological compounds, achieving >70% success rate in identifying lifespan-extending compounds in C. elegans, with one compound increasing lifespan by 74%.

## Mission

To develop an AI-driven polypharmacology platform that identifies compounds targeting multiple aging-related biological pathways simultaneously. The collaboration aims to overcome the limitations of traditional single-target drug discovery approaches by embracing the complexity of aging as a multi-pathway process. The goal is to identify and validate polypharmacological compounds that can extend healthy lifespan by targeting multiple pathways at once.

## Project Information

**Publication Date**: 2025-05
**Objectives**: Develop an AI-driven polypharmacology platform for identifying compounds targeting multiple aging-related pathways,Overcome limitations of traditional single-target drug discovery approaches,Identify and validate polypharmacological compounds that can extend healthy lifespan,Demonstrate feasibility of AI-guided polypharmacology for aging interventions
**Methodology**: Multi-step process combining AI prediction (graph neural networks) with experimental validation in C. elegans model organism
**Results**: [object Object]
**Collaboration Period**: 2025-ongoing

## AI Methods

- Machine Learning
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- Neural Networks
- Polypharmacological Design
- Multi-target Prediction

## Scientific Background

```yaml
ai_necessity: "AI is essential for polypharmacological drug discovery because: (1) Human researchers cannot systematically evaluate millions of compound-pathway combinations, (2) Multi-target optimization requires simultaneous consideration of pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy across multiple pathways, (3) Graph neural networks can effectively model complex relationships in biological networks, making them ideal for polypharmacological prediction tasks, (4) AI enables systematic exploration of polypharmacological space, which was previously intractable due to combinatorial explosion of compound-pathway combinations"
aging_complexity: Aging involves simultaneous dysfunction across multiple biological systems including metabolism, inflammation, DNA repair, protein homeostasis, and neural signaling. Traditional single-target drug discovery approaches fail to address this multi-pathway complexity.
historical_context:
  ai_enablement: AI and machine learning have enabled systematic exploration of polypharmacological space, which was previously intractable due to combinatorial explosion of compound-pathway combinations
  traditional_approach: "Traditional drug discovery has focused on the 'one drug, one target' paradigm, which has been successful for many diseases but fails to address complex multi-pathway processes like aging"
  polypharmacology_evolution: Polypharmacology emerged as a field recognizing that many effective drugs actually act on multiple targets. This approach has gained traction for complex diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and now aging
biological_rationale: Focus on biogenic amine receptors (dopamine, serotonin, histamine) is based on their known roles in aging and longevity. These receptors are involved in neural signaling pathways that modulate aging processes, making them ideal targets for polypharmacological interventions.
model_organism_results: The study demonstrated that over 70% of AI-identified compounds extended C. elegans lifespan, with one novel compound increasing lifespan by 74%. This high hit rate validates the AI-driven polypharmacology approach in vivo.
polypharmacology_concept: Polypharmacology is an approach to drug design that targets multiple biological pathways or receptors simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single target. This approach is particularly relevant for complex diseases and processes like aging, which involve dysfunction across multiple biological systems.
```
