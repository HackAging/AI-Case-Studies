# Sundial Project

## Description

Development of diffusion-field modeling approach for aging dynamics to provide unbiased biological age assessment and aging trajectory prediction

## Mission

To develop a novel diffusion-field modeling approach for aging dynamics that eliminates bias inherent in traditional biological age assessment methods. The project aims to model molecular dynamics through diffusion fields, enabling assessment of both population-level aging processes and individual differences in aging rates. Sundial provides unbiased biological age assessment and predicts individual aging trajectories, identifying individuals with accelerated aging who have increased disease risk compared to traditional age assessment methods.

## Project Information


## Scientific Background

```yaml
aging_mechanism: Aging is a complex process involving molecular changes at multiple levels. Traditional biological age assessment methods may have inherent biases that limit their accuracy. These biases can arise from assumptions about which biomarkers are most important, how aging progresses uniformly across individuals, or from training data that may not represent diverse populations.
unbiased_assessment: "Unlike traditional methods, Sundial eliminates bias in biological age assessment by modeling molecular dynamics directly, providing more objective age estimates. Traditional methods often rely on predefined sets of biomarkers or assume specific relationships between molecular markers and aging, which can introduce bias. Sundial's diffusion-field approach learns the underlying dynamics from the data itself, reducing reliance on prior assumptions."
trajectory_prediction: The model can predict individual aging trajectories, identifying those with accelerated aging who may have increased disease risk. By modeling both population-level patterns and individual variations, Sundial can identify individuals whose aging rate deviates from the population average, which may indicate increased risk for age-related diseases.
disease_risk_prediction: "Research showed that individuals with faster aging identified by Sundial have increased disease risk compared to traditional age assessment methods. This suggests that Sundial's unbiased approach may capture aging-related risk factors that traditional methods miss, potentially improving early detection and intervention strategies."
diffusion_field_approach: Sundial uses diffusion-field modeling to simulate molecular dynamics of aging. This approach captures both population-level aging processes and individual differences in aging rates through a diffusion field framework. Diffusion fields are mathematical constructs that describe how quantities (in this case, molecular states associated with aging) change and spread over time. This approach is inspired by physical diffusion processes but applied to biological aging dynamics.
population_vs_individual: "Sundial models both population-level aging patterns and individual-specific aging rates, enabling more personalized aging assessment. The diffusion field framework naturally captures both scales: the overall field represents population-level trends, while local variations in the field represent individual differences. This dual-scale modeling is a key advantage over methods that focus only on population averages or only on individual markers."
comparison_with_traditional_methods: "Traditional biological age assessment methods typically rely on: (1) predefined biomarker panels (e.g., DNA methylation clocks), (2) linear regression models trained on chronological age, (3) assumptions about uniform aging rates. Sundial differs by: (1) learning dynamics directly from molecular data without predefined markers, (2) using diffusion field framework that captures non-linear aging processes, (3) modeling individual variations explicitly rather than assuming uniform rates."

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Developed novel diffusion-field approach for aging modeling
- Demonstrated ability to identify individuals with accelerated aging and increased disease risk
- Provided unbiased biological age assessment method
- Opened new possibilities for studying age- and sex-specific aging dynamics

### Challenges

- Limited information available about authors' institutional affiliations
- Research is in early stage (preprint, not yet peer-reviewed)
- No commercial implementation or clinical validation yet
- Methodology needs further validation in diverse populations

### Impact on Field

Sundial represents a novel approach to aging assessment using diffusion-field modeling. While still in early research stages, it offers potential for more accurate and unbiased biological age assessment compared to traditional methods. The approach may contribute to better understanding of aging trajectories and disease risk prediction.
