# Kosmos: An AI Scientist for Autonomous Discovery

## Description

Kosmos is an AI scientist system that automates data-driven scientific discovery through iterative cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation. Unlike prior autonomous research systems that lose coherence after limited actions (typically less than 25 iterations), Kosmos uses a structured world model to coordinate between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent, enabling coherent pursuit of research objectives over 200 agent rollouts—8 times more than existing systems.

The core advancement in Kosmos is the use of a structured world model to manage the output of a large number of agents running in parallel. At each discovery cycle, Kosmos launches several parallel instances of two general-purpose agents: a data analysis agent and a literature search agent. Each instance is assigned a specific task aligned with the end objective. The structured world model continuously consolidates and synthesizes information from all agent outputs, enabling every subsequent cycle to build on all previous findings. This context management strategy allows Kosmos to explore many different research avenues simultaneously while maintaining coherence.

Given an open-ended objective and a dataset specified by a scientist, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing iterative discovery cycles. In each cycle, Kosmos executes up to 10 literature search and data analysis tasks in parallel, then updates the world model with summaries of the task outputs. Kosmos then queries the world model to propose literature search and data analysis tasks for the next cycle. This process repeats until Kosmos determines the research objective is complete. The system collectively executes an average of 42,000 lines of code across 166 data analysis agent rollouts and reads 1,500 full-length scientific papers across 36 literature review agent rollouts per run—representing a 9.8x increase in code generation compared to prior systems like Robin.

Once complete, Kosmos synthesizes key discoveries into 3-4 scientific reports. All statements and figures in these reports are directly linked to either a Jupyter notebook created by the data analysis agent or a publication found by the literature search agent, ensuring complete traceability. Independent scientists validated 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports as accurate, and collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average. The number of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles (tested up to 20 cycles).

- Tendency to make excessively strong claims requiring human oversight
- Invents unorthodox quantitative metrics that can be conceptually obscure
- Requires validation by independent expert scientists

**Technical Limitations:**
- Dataset size limit: approximately 5GB maximum
- Cannot excel at analyzing raw data (images, raw sequencing files)
- Cannot autonomously access external data sources for reference or validation
- Stochastic nature: multiple runs may not consistently converge on same discoveries
- Sensitive to phrasing of research objectives

**Discovery Identification:**
- Time-intensive process requiring domain expertise
- Average report contains 3-4 narratives with 25 claims each based on 8-9 trajectories
- No automated method to evaluate claim accuracy, novelty, and significance at scale
- Scale mismatch: Kosmos performs data-driven discovery at scale, but identifying meaningful discoveries at scale remains challenge

**System Behavior:**
- Can veer in unexpected trajectories
- Central value: extensive unbiased exploration can reliably uncover true phenomena (not that Kosmos is always correct)
- Requires "scientific taste" alignment through training
