# Unity Biotechnology, Inc.

## Description

Pioneer in senolytic therapies targeting senescent cells to treat age-related diseases. The company developed UBX1325 (Foselutoclax) for eye diseases and UBX0101 for osteoarthritis. Despite positive Phase 2b results for UBX1325, the company liquidated in September 2025 after facing financial challenges and regulatory hurdles.

## Mission

To develop therapeutics that slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging by eliminating senescent cells. The company aimed to extend healthspan by developing senolytic drugs for treating conditions such as osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, eye diseases, and kidney diseases.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Unity Biotechnology, Inc.
**Founded**: 2011
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"peak":70,"as_of":"2018","at_liquidation":0}
**Ticker**: UBX (NASDAQ)
**Focus**: Development of senolytic therapies targeting senescent cells to treat age-related diseases
**Website**: https://unitybiotechnology.com

## Scientific Background

```yaml
bcl_xl_targeting: Bcl-xL is an anti-apoptotic protein that is overexpressed in senescent cells, making them resistant to cell death. Inhibiting Bcl-xL allows senescent cells to undergo apoptosis.
p53_mdm2_targeting: The p53/MDM2 interaction regulates cell cycle and apoptosis. Inhibiting this interaction in senescent cells can trigger their elimination.
senolytic_approach: Senolytics are drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells by inducing apoptosis. This approach aims to remove the source of inflammation and tissue damage associated with aging.
senescence_mechanism: Cellular senescence is a state in which cells stop dividing and enter a state of permanent growth arrest. Senescent cells accumulate with age and secrete pro-inflammatory factors that contribute to age-related diseases.
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Successfully advanced UBX1325 to Phase 2b with positive results
- Demonstrated proof-of-concept for Bcl-xL targeting in senescent cells
- Established senolytics as a viable therapeutic approach
- Generated valuable clinical data despite company closure

### Challenges

- High cost of clinical development for senolytic therapies
- Difficulty in demonstrating clear efficacy endpoints in age-related diseases
- Long development timelines requiring significant capital
- Competition from established anti-VEGF therapies in ophthalmology

### Impact on Field

Unity Biotechnology was a pioneer in the senolytic space, helping to establish the field and demonstrating that targeting senescent cells is a viable therapeutic approach, even though the company itself did not succeed commercially.
