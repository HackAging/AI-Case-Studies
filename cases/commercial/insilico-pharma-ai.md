- Reduced drug discovery timeline from 10-15 years to 12-18 months for preclinical candidate nomination
- Achieved target discovery to Phase 1 in <30 months (vs. 10+ years traditional)
- Nominated over 20 preclinical candidates since 2021 with only 60-200 molecules synthesized per program (vs. thousands in traditional methods)
- Established Pharma.AI as a commercially viable platform with multiple major pharma partnerships

### Impact on Field

Insilico Medicine has been a pioneer in demonstrating that generative AI can successfully accelerate and transform drug discovery. The company proved that AI can not only discover novel targets but also design effective molecules, with Rentosertib being the first AI-discovered target AND AI-designed molecule to show efficacy in humans. This validates the end-to-end AI pharma model and establishes a template for rapid development of multiple aging interventions. The platform's success has attracted major pharma partnerships worth over $4.5 billion, demonstrating industry confidence in AI-driven drug discovery.
