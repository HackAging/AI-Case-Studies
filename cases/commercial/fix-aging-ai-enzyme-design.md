aging_frameworks:
  -
    name: SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence)
    founder: Aubrey de Grey
    description: Framework developed by Aubrey de Grey that groups aging damage into seven broad categories for which repair strategies are envisioned. SENS advocates directly repairing the damage that accumulates with age rather than trying to slow its accumulation.
    organization: SENS Research Foundation
    seven_categories:
    -
    category: Cell Loss
    description: "Cells die and are not replaced. Repair strategy: stem cell therapy, tissue engineering"
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: Not directly addressed by enzyme design, but complementary approach
    -
    category: Death-Resistant Cells
    description: "Senescent cells that refuse to die and secrete harmful factors. Repair strategy: senolytics (drugs that kill senescent cells)"
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: Not directly addressed, but enzyme design could potentially target senescent cell markers
    -
    category: Nuclear Mutations
    description: "Mutations in nuclear DNA that can cause cancer. Repair strategy: gene therapy, telomere extension"
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: Not directly addressed by enzyme design
    -
    category: Mitochondrial Mutations
    description: "Mutations in mitochondrial DNA affecting energy production. Repair strategy: mitochondrial gene therapy, allotopic expression"
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: Not directly addressed by enzyme design
    -
    category: Intracellular Junk
    description: "Harmful aggregates that accumulate inside cells (lipofuscin, protein aggregates, oxidized cholesterol). Repair strategy: engineered enzymes to degrade these aggregates"
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: "PRIMARY FOCUS - Fix Aging AI's main target category"
    -
    category: Extracellular Junk

    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: "SECONDARY FOCUS - Addressed by Fix Aging AI's approach"
    -
    category: Extracellular Crosslinks
    description: "Cross-links in extracellular matrix proteins (glucosepane in collagen, etc.) that stiffen tissues. Repair strategy: engineered enzymes to break cross-links"
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: PRIMARY FOCUS - Glucosepane degradation is a key target
    historical_context: "SENS framework was developed in early 2000s and has guided longevity research for over two decades. Fix Aging AI's approach directly implements SENS strategies for intracellular/extracellular junk and crosslinks using AI-enabled enzyme design."
    fix_aging_ai_priorities:
    - Intracellular Junk (primary focus)
    - Extracellular Crosslinks (primary focus - glucosepane)
    - Extracellular Junk (secondary focus)
  -
    name: Hallmarks of Aging
    hallmarks:
    - Genomic instability
    - Telomere attrition
    - Epigenetic alterations
    - Loss of proteostasis
    - Deregulated nutrient sensing
    - Mitochondrial dysfunction
    - Cellular senescence
    - Stem cell exhaustion
    - Altered intercellular communication
    - Disabled macroautophagy

    - Dysbiosis
    description: Framework describing aging as resulting from a handful of core damage processes. Originally proposed by López-Otín et al. in 2013, updated in 2023. Advocates addressing these hallmarks to combat aging.
    updated_paper: López-Otín et al., Cell 2023
    original_paper: López-Otín et al., Cell 2013
    relevance_to_fix_aging_ai: "Fix Aging AI addresses 'Loss of proteostasis' (protein aggregates, misfolded proteins) and contributes to addressing 'Cellular senescence' indirectly through damage repair"
impact_potential: "If AI-designed enzymes can clear glucosepane crosslinks (which stiffen arteries and ligaments with age), it could roll back aspects of aging that no small molecule can touch. This represents a new category of rejuvenation therapy: garbage cleanup enzymes for aging damage previously infeasible to target."
target_molecules:
  -
    name: Intracellular Junk
    examples:
    -
    name: Oxidized Cholesterol Derivatives
    description: Oxidized forms of cholesterol (oxysterols) that accumulate in cells with age, contributing to cellular dysfunction and age-related diseases. These include 7-ketocholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and other oxidized metabolites that can be toxic to cells.
    pathogenicity: Can cause cellular dysfunction, inflammation, and contribute to atherosclerosis and other age-related conditions
    enzymatic_feasibility: Potentially degradable by designed enzymes targeting specific oxidation products

    description: Intracellular cross-linked proteins and other molecules that form stable, non-degradable aggregates within cells
    pathogenicity: Interfere with cellular function, contribute to cellular aging and dysfunction

    enzymatic_feasibility: Challenging due to complex composition, may require multiple enzymes or sequential degradation
    description: Harmful molecular aggregates that accumulate within cells with age, including oxidized cholesterol derivatives, misfolded protein aggregates, and cross-linked waste products that cells cannot naturally remove
    sens_category: Intracellular junk - one of the seven SENS categories of aging damage
  -
    name: Extracellular Matrix Crosslinks
    description: Cross-links in the extracellular matrix, such as glucosepane in collagen, that accumulate with age and stiffen tissues (arteries, ligaments), reducing elasticity and function
    sens_category: Extracellular crosslinks - one of the seven SENS categories of aging damage
    primary_target:
    name: Glucosepane
    structure: Complex cross-link formed between lysine and arginine residues in proteins through reaction with glucose
    description: Advanced glycation end-product (AGE) that forms cross-links in collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. Glucosepane is the most abundant AGE cross-link in human tissues, particularly in long-lived proteins like collagen in skin, arteries, and ligaments.
    accumulation: Increases with age, particularly in tissues with slow protein turnover (skin, arteries, ligaments, cartilage)
    significance: If AI-designed enzymes can clear glucosepane crosslinks, it could roll back aspects of aging that no small molecule can touch, representing a new category of rejuvenation therapy
    research_status: Active area of SENS Research Foundation research, but no effective degradation method yet developed
    pathological_effects:
    - "Tissue stiffening: Reduces elasticity of arteries (contributing to hypertension and cardiovascular disease)"
    - "Ligament stiffening: Reduces flexibility and contributes to age-related mobility issues"
    - "Skin aging: Contributes to loss of skin elasticity and wrinkles"
    - "Cartilage degradation: May contribute to joint stiffness and osteoarthritis"
    enzymatic_feasibility: "Highly challenging - glucosepane cross-links are buried deep within densely packed collagen fibrils, making them physically inaccessible to enzymes. This is a key challenge addressed by Fix Aging AI's approach."
    other_crosslinks:
    - Pentosidine
    - Methylglyoxal-derived crosslinks
    - Other AGE crosslinks
  -
    name: Extracellular Aggregates
    examples:
    - "Amyloid-beta plaques (Alzheimer's disease)"
    - Other extracellular protein aggregates
    - Extracellular matrix modifications
    description: Extracellular plaques and aggregates contributing to age-related diseases
    sens_category: Extracellular junk - one of the seven SENS categories of aging damage
damage_repair_approach: Aging is viewed as the accumulation of various forms of damage in cells and tissues. The damage repair approach aims to directly repair this underlying cellular and molecular damage before it leads to disease, effectively rejuvenating the body and extending healthy lifespan.
enzyme_design_approach: Traditional enzyme design through directed evolution requires testing tens of thousands of variants to maybe find one active enzyme. AI methods have designed active enzymes in just a handful of tries by coordinating complex design steps (structure prediction, generative design, docking) in an iterative loop, enabling systematic exploration of enzyme design space.
