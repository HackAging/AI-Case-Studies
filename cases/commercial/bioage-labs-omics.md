# BioAge Labs Omics-Based Biomarker Discovery

## Description

BioAge Labs uses a proprietary omics-based biomarker discovery platform that analyzes longitudinal omics data collected over decades to identify molecular mediators of aging and disease. The platform employs a human-centric, data-driven approach starting from healthy individuals and tracking health trajectories over time.

## Mission

To develop therapeutics that extend healthy lifespan by targeting the molecular causes of aging. BioAge Labs uses a human-centric, data-driven approach to identify molecular features of healthy aging and causes of age-related diseases.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: BioAge Labs, Inc.
**Founded**: 2015
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"as_of":"2024-2025","current":"50-64"}
**Ticker**: BIOA (NASDAQ)
**Focus**: Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for metabolic diseases such as obesity by targeting human aging biology
**Website**: https://bioagelabs.com

## Scientific Background

```yaml
nlrp3_biology:
  mechanism: NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, which drive chronic inflammation. This chronic inflammation is a key driver of age-related pathology.
  description: "NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) is a key component of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in the innate immune system's response to infection and cellular stress."
  role_in_aging: NLRP3 inflammasome activation is associated with chronic inflammation (inflammaging), which is considered one of the hallmarks of aging. Chronic activation of NLRP3 contributes to age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, and neurodegenerative conditions.
  therapeutic_rationale: "Inhibiting NLRP3 can reduce chronic inflammation associated with aging, potentially slowing or preventing age-related diseases. BGE-102's CNS penetration allows it to target neuroinflammation, which is increasingly recognized as a contributor to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases."
  connection_to_hallmarks: NLRP3 activation is linked to multiple hallmarks of aging including chronic inflammation, cellular senescence, and altered intercellular communication.
apj_apelin_biology:
  mechanism: Apelin/APJ signaling improves glucose metabolism, enhances muscle function, promotes angiogenesis, and has cardioprotective effects. Exercise increases apelin secretion, and apelin/APJ signaling mediates many of the beneficial effects of exercise.
  description: The apelin receptor (APJ) is a G-protein coupled receptor that is activated by apelin, a peptide hormone secreted in response to exercise and physical activity.
  role_in_aging: Apelin/APJ signaling plays important roles in metabolism, muscle function, and cardiovascular health. Levels of apelin decline with age, and this decline is associated with age-related metabolic dysfunction, muscle loss (sarcopenia), and decreased exercise capacity.
  exercise_mimetic: Azelaprag acts as an exercise mimetic by activating the same pathways that are activated during physical exercise, potentially providing the metabolic and muscle benefits of exercise without requiring physical activity.
  therapeutic_rationale: Agonizing APJ can mimic the beneficial effects of exercise, potentially providing exercise mimetics that could help maintain muscle mass, improve metabolism, and enhance cardiovascular health in aging individuals. This is particularly relevant for individuals who cannot exercise due to frailty or disability.
  connection_to_hallmarks: Apelin/APJ signaling is connected to multiple hallmarks of aging including altered nutrient sensing, loss of proteostasis (muscle maintenance), and cellular senescence (through effects on muscle stem cells).
historical_context:
  omics_evolution: The field of omics-based drug discovery has evolved from single-omics studies (genomics alone) to multi-omics integration, enabled by advances in sequencing, mass spectrometry, and computational methods. BioAge represents a next-generation approach that leverages longitudinal human data.
  aging_biomarkers_history: "Early aging biomarkers focused on chronological age predictors. Modern approaches, like BioAge's, focus on identifying molecular mediators that can be targeted therapeutically, moving from biomarkers of aging to targets for intervention."
  place_in_longevity_landscape: "BioAge Labs is positioned in the human data-driven longevity biotechnology space, alongside companies like Calico (Google), Unity Biotechnology, and others. BioAge's unique approach focuses on metabolic aging and uses human longitudinal data rather than model organisms."
omics_approach_rationale:
  unbiased_discovery: The omics-based approach is unbiased, allowing discovery of novel targets that may not be obvious from traditional hypothesis-driven research. This led to identification of NLRP3 and APJ as therapeutic targets for aging-related conditions.
  human_centric_advantage: "Traditional drug discovery relies heavily on animal models, which may not accurately reflect human aging biology. BioAge's human-centric approach analyzes actual human aging data, identifying targets that are relevant to human aging processes."
  longitudinal_data_advantage: Longitudinal data allows tracking of molecular changes over time, identifying early biomarkers of disease and understanding trajectories from health to disease. This is not possible with cross-sectional studies.
  comparison_to_traditional_approaches: "Traditional biomarker discovery often focuses on single molecules or pathways. BioAge's multi-omics approach integrates information across genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, providing a more comprehensive view of aging biology."

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Successfully developed proprietary omics-based biomarker discovery platform analyzing longitudinal human data
- Identified NLRP3 as key therapeutic target for cardiovascular risk reduction through omics analysis
- Identified APJ (apelin receptor) as therapeutic target for obesity through omics analysis
- Advanced BGE-102 to Phase 1 with positive interim results showing good tolerability and biomarker reduction
- Advanced Azelaprag to Phase 2 in combination with incretin therapies
- Established strategic partnerships with Novartis ($20M upfront, up to $530M milestones) and Lilly ExploR&D
- Successfully completed IPO raising $198M at $602M valuation
- Expanded platform with HUNT Biobank partnership (17,000+ samples)
- Demonstrated proof-of-concept for human data-driven drug discovery approach

### Challenges

- Long development timelines for aging-related therapeutics
- Need for large-scale longitudinal human data for omics analysis
- Regulatory pathway for aging-related therapeutics requires validation
- Competition in obesity and metabolic disease markets
- Safety concerns leading to trial discontinuation (Azelaprag Phase 2 STRIDES)
- Need to balance efficacy with safety in aging populations

### Impact on Field

BioAge Labs has established a human-centric, data-driven approach to drug discovery by analyzing longitudinal omics data to identify molecular mediators of aging and disease. The company's platform demonstrates that analyzing human aging data can identify novel therapeutic targets (NLRP3, APJ) that may not be obvious from traditional preclinical models. The success of BGE-102 and Azelaprag in clinical development validates the approach of using human omics data to guide drug discovery for aging-related conditions. The company's partnerships with Novartis and Lilly demonstrate industry recognition of the value of this approach.
