### AI Virtual Cell Platform
**Alternative Names**: AI Cell Simulator, Virtual Cell Technology
**Type**: platform
**Status**: In development
**Development Stage**: Preclinical
**Role in Project**: primary
**Relationship Description**: Primary AI platform for cellular rejuvenation research
**Description**: AI-powered virtual cell platform that combines generative AI models with highly accurate aging clocks to predict gene combinations for safe cellular rejuvenation. Platform compresses centuries of traditional experiments into months through in silico screening.
**Mechanism of Action**: The platform operates through a multi-step process: (1) Input: Large-scale proprietary multiomic datasets (transcriptomic, epigenomic) from cells at different ages are fed into generative AI models. (2) Virtual cell generation: Generative AI models (based on transformer architecture, similar to scGPT developed by Bo Wang) create virtual representations of cells that can simulate responses to genetic perturbations. (3) Aging clock integration: A highly accurate single-cell transcriptomic aging clock measures the predicted cellular age after each simulated genetic intervention. (4) Iterative optimization: Reinforcement learning algorithms iteratively propose gene combinations (single genes or multi-gene sets) that maximize rejuvenation (reduce predicted age) while maintaining cell identity markers. (5) Ranking and validation: The platform ranks candidate interventions by predicted efficacy and safety metrics. Top candidates are then tested in wet-lab experiments on human cells. This in silico screening process compresses what would take centuries of traditional one-factor-at-a-time experiments into months.
**Target**: Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic aging pathways
**Pathway**: Cellular aging and rejuvenation pathways
**Capabilities**:
- Simulate thousands of gene combinations in silico
- Predict cellular rejuvenation effects without pluripotency induction
- Measure cellular age with single-cell resolution
- Maintain cell identity during rejuvenation
- Compress centuries of experiments into months
- Validate predictions through wet-lab experiments
**Indications**: [
  {
    "primary": "Age-driven diseases",
    "secondary": "Cellular rejuvenation for age-related conditions"
  }
]
**Technical Details**:
