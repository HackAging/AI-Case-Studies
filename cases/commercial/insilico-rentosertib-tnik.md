# Insilico Medicine - Rentosertib (TNIK Inhibitor)

## Description

First AI-discovered target (TNIK) AND AI-designed molecule (Rentosertib) to show efficacy in human clinical trials for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

## Mission

To extend healthy and productive longevity for all by transforming drug discovery and development through generative artificial intelligence, significantly reducing the time and cost to deliver life-saving medicines to patients.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Insilico Medicine, Inc.
**Founded**: 2014
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Focus**: AI-driven drug discovery and development using generative artificial intelligence
**Website**: https://insilico.com/

## AI Methods

- Multi-omics Integration
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Transformer Neural Networks
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

## Platforms

- Pharma.AI
- PandaOmics
- Chemistry42

## Technical Workflow

```yaml
methodology:
  - "Step 1: Target Discovery - PandaOmics identified TNIK from multi-omics analysis"
  - "Step 2: Molecule Generation - Chemistry42 generated thousands of candidate molecules"
  - "Step 3: Optimization - RL-based multi-objective optimization"
  - "Step 4: Synthesis Prioritization - AI-guided selection"
  - "Step 5: Experimental Validation - In vitro and in vivo testing"
  - "Step 6: Preclinical Candidate - Rentosertib nominated as lead"
```

## Performance Metrics

```yaml
timeline:
  comparison: "Traditional: 10+ years"
  acceleration_factor: 3-4x faster
  target_discovery_to_phase_1: <30 months
  target_discovery_to_preclinical: 18 months
clinical_results:
  fvc_placebo: -20.3 ml
  fvc_improvement_60mg: +98.4 ml
  phase_2a_participants: 71
  statistical_significance: true
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- First AI-discovered target (TNIK) AND AI-designed molecule to show efficacy in humans
- Proved end-to-end AI pharma model works - from target identification to clinical validation
- Demonstrated 3-4x acceleration vs traditional methods (18 months target to preclinical, <30 months to Phase 1)
- Positive Phase 2a results: +98.4 ml FVC improvement vs -20.3 ml placebo (statistically significant)
- Validated that AI-designed molecules can successfully treat age-related conditions in humans
- Published in Nature Medicine (June 2025), establishing scientific credibility

### Challenges

- IPF is a complex disease with heterogeneous patient populations
- Fibrosis reversal is challenging - most existing therapies only slow progression
- Need for larger Phase 2 studies to confirm efficacy in broader populations
- Development of inhalation formulation for better pulmonary delivery

### Impact on Field

Rentosertib represents a critical milestone in AI-driven drug discovery. It is the first drug where both the target was discovered by AI (PandaOmics identified TNIK) and the molecule was designed by AI (Chemistry42 designed Rentosertib), and it demonstrated efficacy in human clinical trials. This proves that the end-to-end AI pharma model works and validates the strategy of targeting age-associated pathways (fibrosis) rather than just single diseases. The drug's positive Phase 2a results (+98.4 ml FVC improvement) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis provides clinical proof that AI can accelerate and transform drug discovery for aging-related conditions.
