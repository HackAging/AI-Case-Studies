# Altos Labs iPSC-Based Therapies

## Description

Development of cellular rejuvenation programming and iPSC-based therapies to restore cell health and resilience, aiming to reverse disease, injury, and disabilities that occur throughout life

## Mission

To restore cell health and resilience through cell rejuvenation programming to reverse disease, injury, and the disabilities that can occur throughout life. Altos Labs aims to transform medicine by developing therapies that can rejuvenate cells and tissues, potentially extending healthy lifespan and treating age-related diseases.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Altos Labs, Inc.
**Founded**: 2021
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"peak":571,"as_of":"2025","current":571}
**Focus**: Development of cellular rejuvenation programming and iPSC-based therapies to restore cell health and resilience, aiming to reverse disease, injury, and disabilities that occur throughout life
**Website**: https://www.altoslabs.com/

## Scientific Background

```yaml
ai_optimization: Altos Labs uses AI and machine learning to optimize cellular reprogramming protocols, predict optimal transcription factor combinations, and systematically explore reprogramming strategies for different cell types and conditions.
ipsc_technology: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are adult cells that have been reprogrammed to a pluripotent state, similar to embryonic stem cells. This technology, pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka (Nobel Prize 2012), allows cells to be reprogrammed and then differentiated into various cell types for therapeutic use.
therapeutic_approach: The company focuses on developing iPSC-based therapies that can be used to treat neurodegeneration and immune aging, with the goal of extending healthy lifespan and reversing age-related diseases.
cellular_rejuvenation: Cellular rejuvenation involves reversing the aging process at the cellular level through epigenetic reprogramming. This can restore cell function and potentially reverse age-related damage.
```

## Lessons Learned
