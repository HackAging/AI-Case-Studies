**Date**: 2021-09-01
**Focus**: Closed-loop AI-driven drug discovery
**Description**: Collaboration to apply AI and cloud technologies for accelerating closed-loop molecule discovery. IBM Research's RXN for Chemistry platform (using advanced NLP architectures for synthetic chemistry automation) integrates with Arctoris' Ulysses platform to create an autonomous approach to design, synthesis, testing, and analysis of new small molecules. This creates a complete closed-loop system: AI designs molecules (RXN), robots synthesize and test them (Ulysses), AI analyzes results and designs next iterations.
**Partner Organizations**:
- IBM Research (partner)
  - Technology partner - RXN for Chemistry integration
**Details**:
```yaml
technical_integration: RXN for Chemistry (IBM) handles molecular design and synthesis planning, while Ulysses (Arctoris) executes biological assays. Results feed back to RXN for iterative optimization, creating autonomous discovery cycle
closed_loop_components:
  - AI designs molecules (IBM RXN)
  - Robots synthesize and test (Arctoris Ulysses)
  - AI analyzes results (IBM)
  - Next iteration designed (autonomous cycle)
```
