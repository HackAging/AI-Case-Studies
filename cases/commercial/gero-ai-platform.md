# Gero AI Platform - Protein Dynamics and Trajectory Mapping

## Description

AI platform for predicting protein dynamics during aging and generating drug molecules. Consists of two components: protein dynamics prediction system using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on 100M+ records, and ProtoBind-Diff model for structure-free molecule generation using only amino acid sequences.

## Mission

To apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to aging research and chronic diseases. Gero aims to develop AI platforms that can model protein dynamics, map aging trajectories, and accelerate drug discovery for age-related conditions. The company focuses on understanding biological aging processes and developing interventions to extend healthy lifespan.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Gero Pte. Ltd.
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"note":"Employee count not publicly disclosed. Company appears to be a small to medium-sized biotech startup.","as_of":"2025"}
**Focus**: Application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to aging research and chronic diseases. Development of AI platforms for protein dynamics prediction, aging trajectory mapping, and drug discovery.
**Website**: https://gero.ai

## Scientific Background

```yaml
trajectory_mapping: Aging trajectory mapping allows identification of how biological systems change over time during aging. By mapping these trajectories, the platform can identify new therapeutic targets that may not be apparent from static analysis.
proteostasis_decline: Proteostasis decline is a hallmark of aging, characterized by accumulation of misfolded proteins and dysfunction of protein quality control systems. The platform specifically targets this mechanism to identify interventions.
structure_free_approach: ProtoBind-Diff represents a paradigm shift by using only protein sequences rather than 3D structures. This approach leverages the much larger pool of activity data available in public databases, enabling the model to generalize to underexplored targets with limited or unavailable structural data.
biological_justification: "Proteostasis decline is a fundamental aging mechanism. Misfolded proteins accumulate with age, disrupting cellular function and leading to age-related diseases (Alzheimer's, heart disease, diabetes). By predicting protein dynamics and identifying intervention targets, the platform addresses root causes of aging rather than symptoms."
comparison_with_baseline:
  protein_dynamics: "Traditional methods: limited to small-scale simulations, computationally expensive. Gero platform: scales to 100M+ records, predicts dynamics beyond supercomputer capabilities."
  target_discovery: "Traditional methods: 5-10 targets over several years through experimental screening. Gero platform: 50 targets in one year through AI-driven trajectory mapping (5-10x improvement)."
  molecule_generation: "Structure-based methods: work with ~20% of proteins (those with known 3D structures). ProtoBind-Diff: works with 80-90% of proteins (those with known sequences), 4-5x expansion of druggable target space."
protein_dynamics_approach: "Protein dynamics prediction is critical for understanding proteostasis decline in aging. Traditional computational methods are limited by the scale of simulations required. Gero's platform uses GNNs trained on massive datasets (100M+ records) to predict protein dynamics at scales beyond what supercomputers can simulate."
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Successfully developed structure-free AI model (ProtoBind-Diff) that works without 3D protein structures
- Trained GNNs on 100M+ records for protein dynamics prediction
- Identified 50 new targets through aging trajectory mapping in 2025
- Demonstrated successful collaboration with Scripps Research on polypharmacology
- Created paradigm shift in molecular generation by using sequences rather than structures

### Challenges

- Limited public information available for private biotech companies
- Protein dynamics simulation at scale requires massive computational resources
- Structure-free approaches need large training datasets to be effective
- Translating aging trajectory insights into therapeutic targets requires validation

### Impact on Field

Gero's platform demonstrates that AI can enable protein dynamics prediction and aging trajectory mapping at scales beyond traditional computational methods. The structure-free approach of ProtoBind-Diff expands the druggable target space, particularly for challenging therapeutic areas. The collaboration with Scripps Research shows promise for AI-driven polypharmacology in aging interventions. The platform's ability to identify 50 new targets through trajectory mapping demonstrates the discovery potential of this approach.
