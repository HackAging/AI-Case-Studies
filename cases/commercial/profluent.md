# Profluent Bio

## Description

AI-powered protein design and gene editing company. First company whose LLMs successfully created functional proteins. Developed OpenCRISPR-1, the first CRISPR system created from scratch using AI.

## Mission

To use AI to 'read' and 'write' biomolecules for applications in medicine and industry. Profluent develops deep generative models to create and validate new functional proteins, revolutionizing biomedicine by enabling programmable biology through foundational AI models.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Profluent Bio
**Founded**: 2022
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"as_of":"2024","current":"Not disclosed"}
**Focus**: AI-powered protein design and gene editing. Developing deep generative models to create and validate new functional proteins, gene editors, enzymes, antibodies, and bioproducts for medicine, agriculture, and bioproduction
**Website**: https://www.profluent.bio

## Scientific Background

```yaml
llm_for_proteins:
  concept: "Proteins can be treated as 'languages' where amino acids are 'words'. LLMs trained on protein sequences learn the 'grammar' of functional proteins."
  milestone: Profluent was first to demonstrate LLMs can generate functional proteins, validating the approach.
  scaling_laws: ProGen3 demonstrates that scaling laws from NLP (larger models + more data = better performance) apply to protein design, suggesting continued improvements with scale.
biological_context:
  gene_editing: CRISPR systems use Cas proteins to cut DNA at specific locations, enabling precise gene editing. Improving Cas proteins improves editing safety and efficacy.
  protein_function: Proteins are molecular machines that perform biological functions. Their sequence determines their structure and function.
  longevity_implications: "AI-designed proteins and gene editors could enable: (1) Novel therapeutic proteins targeting aging mechanisms, (2) Safer gene editing for age-related conditions, (3) Faster development of longevity interventions"
crispr_design_challenge:
  impact: OpenCRISPR-1 demonstrates AI can create gene editors with better safety profiles than natural systems.
  ai_design_advantage: "AI can design Cas9 variants from scratch, exploring sequence space to find variants with improved properties that don't exist in nature."
  natural_limitations: "Natural Cas9 systems have limitations: (1) Off-target effects (unintended DNA cuts), (2) Immunogenicity (immune system recognition), (3) Limited sequence diversity (only natural variants available)"
protein_design_challenge:
  ai_advantage: "AI models can explore vast sequence space computationally, identifying functional sequences that natural evolution hasn't discovered."
  sequence_space: Protein sequence space is astronomically large (20^N for N-length proteins). Natural evolution has explored only a tiny fraction of this space.
  traditional_limitations: "Traditional protein design relies on: (1) Natural protein libraries (limited diversity), (2) Rational design (requires structural knowledge), (3) Directed evolution (slow, iterative). These methods have low success rates."
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- First company whose LLMs successfully created functional proteins
- Developed first CRISPR system created from scratch using AI (OpenCRISPR-1)
- Raised $150M total funding ($35M in 2024, $106M in 2025)
- Published research in Nature and Nature Biotechnology
- Successfully demonstrated human genome editing with OpenCRISPR-1
- Established partnerships with Corteva Agriscience and Ensoma
- Introduced ProGen3 trained on world's largest protein sequence dataset (80+ billion sequences)
- Developed Protein2PAM for predicting protein-DNA interactions without lab experiments

### Challenges

- Training LLMs on massive protein sequence datasets (80+ billion sequences)
- Validating AI-designed proteins and gene editors in laboratory and clinical settings
- Reducing off-target effects and immunogenicity in AI-designed gene editors
- Scaling foundational models for diverse applications across medicine, agriculture, and bioproduction

### Impact on Field

Profluent represents a paradigm shift in programmable biology, being the first company to successfully use LLMs to create functional proteins and the first to create a CRISPR system from scratch using AI. The OpenCRISPR-1 system's reduced off-target effects and lower immunogenicity address key limitations of traditional gene editing tools. For longevity research, AI-designed gene editors could enable precise editing of aging-related genes with improved safety profiles. The ability to generate functional proteins through LLMs opens new possibilities for creating therapeutic proteins targeting aging mechanisms. The ProGen3 model's training on 80+ billion sequences demonstrates the scaling potential of foundation models in biology, similar to how LLMs transformed natural language processing. This could accelerate the development of protein-based longevity interventions by orders of magnitude.
