## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- First PROTAC targeting PKMYT1 designed entirely using generative AI
- Demonstrated Chemistry42's capability in designing complex therapeutic modalities beyond traditional small molecules
- Achieved exceptional selectivity: inhibited only 4 out of 403 tested kinases (0.99% hit rate)
- Generated over 2,000 candidate molecules and selected optimal PROTAC
- Dual-action mechanism provides advantages over traditional inhibitors
- Strong anti-tumor activity in biomarker-positive tumor models
- Published in Nature Communications (November 2025), demonstrating scientific credibility

### Impact on Field

D16-M1P2 demonstrates the potential of AI platforms like Chemistry42 to accelerate development of complex therapeutic modalities. This represents one of the first examples of complete PROTAC design (warhead + linker) using generative AI, showcasing how AI can tackle more complex challenges beyond traditional small molecule design. The dual-action mechanism and exceptional selectivity demonstrate that AI can design superior therapeutics with novel mechanisms. The success validates using AI for PROTAC design, a growing therapeutic modality.
