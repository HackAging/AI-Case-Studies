# Latent Labs

## Description

Founded by DeepMind alumnus Simon Kohl (co-author of AlphaFold2), Latent Labs develops generative AI models for programmable biology. Provides accessible web-based platform (Latent-X) for protein binder design and Latent-X2 for antibody generation with drug-like properties.

## Mission

To make biology programmable by providing biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with AI-powered tools for creating and optimizing proteins, antibodies, and enzymes. The company aims to transform healthcare and sustainable development by enabling researchers to design novel therapeutic molecules and optimize existing biological systems using generative AI models.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Latent Labs
**Founded**: 2023
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"as_of":"2025-02","current":15}
**Focus**: Development of generative AI models for programmable biology, enabling creation and optimization of proteins, antibodies, and enzymes
**Website**: https://www.latentlabs.com

## Scientific Background

```yaml
biological_context:
  antibodies: Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that bind to specific targets. Therapeutic antibodies are major class of biologics, but development is slow and costly.
  protein_binders: Proteins that bind to specific targets (epitopes) can be used therapeutically to modulate biological processes or as diagnostic tools.
  longevity_implications: "AI-designed proteins and antibodies could enable: (1) Novel therapeutics targeting aging mechanisms, (2) Faster development of age-related disease treatments, (3) Personalized interventions based on individual aging profiles"
programmable_biology:
  impact: Programmable biology accelerates therapeutic development by enabling rapid design and testing of biological molecules.
  concept: Making biology programmable means enabling researchers to design biological molecules (proteins, antibodies) with desired properties, similar to programming software.
  tools_needed: "Requires: (1) AI models that understand biological 'code' (sequences), (2) Accessible platforms for non-programmers, (3) Validation capabilities"
protein_binder_design:
  challenge: Designing proteins that bind to specific targets (epitopes) is complex. Traditional methods require extensive experimental screening and optimization.
  ai_advantage: Generative AI can explore vast sequence space computationally, identifying binding candidates before laboratory testing.
  applications: "Protein binders can be used as: (1) Therapeutic proteins, (2) Diagnostic tools, (3) Research reagents"
antibody_design_challenge:
  ai_solution: AI models can predict and optimize for developability and immunogenicity during generation, reducing need for iterative optimization.
  developability: "Therapeutic antibodies must have drug-like properties: stability, expression, manufacturability. Many designed antibodies fail at this stage."
  immunogenicity: Antibodies can trigger immune responses, limiting therapeutic use. Low immunogenicity is critical for therapeutic success.
  traditional_limitations: Traditional antibody development requires multiple rounds of optimization to achieve developability and low immunogenicity, extending development timelines.
```
