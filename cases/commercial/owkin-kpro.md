# Owkin KPro: Intelligent Research Agent for Biopharma

## Description

KPro is an agentic AI co-pilot for biopharma powered by biological reasoning models. Launched in October 2025, KPro represents Owkin's most advanced AI research agent, designed to help pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms make more informed decisions across all stages of drug development. The platform integrates OwkinZero, a specialized biological language model trained on high-quality multimodal biomedical data, including the MOSAIC spatial multi-omics oncology dataset—one of the largest curated oncology datasets in the world.

KPro enables researchers to ask complex biological questions in natural language and receive actionable, clinically relevant answers. The platform consolidates disparate workflows into a unified, insight-driven research experience, providing access to integrated clinical, molecular, and spatial data. KPro has demonstrated significant acceleration of internal processes, reducing target identification time from 12+ months to 3 months (70% acceleration) and enabling asset positioning strategies ready for IND submission in hours instead of months.

The platform builds upon K Navigator, which was launched in May 2025 and demonstrated 20x productivity increases for researchers. KPro extends these capabilities specifically for pharmaceutical applications, offering both free and enterprise versions. The enterprise version provides advanced features, integrations, and premium support, with personalized demonstrations and "Katalyst sessions" for accelerated onboarding.
