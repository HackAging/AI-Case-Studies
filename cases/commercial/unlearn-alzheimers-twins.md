# Unlearn.AI - Alzheimer's Digital Twins in Phase 2a

## Description

Application of AI-powered digital twin technology in Alzheimer's disease Phase 2a clinical trials to strengthen confidence in early clinical signals and accelerate drug development. Partnership between Unlearn.AI and remynd demonstrates practical use of disease-specific digital twins trained on 26,000+ participants.

## Mission

To accelerate clinical trials and improve drug development by creating AI-powered digital twins of patients that enable smaller control groups, faster enrollment, and more efficient clinical research while maintaining scientific rigor and regulatory compliance.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Unlearn.AI, Inc.
**Founded**: 2017
**Industry**: Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Clinical Trials
**Employees**: {"peak":60,"as_of":"2024","current":60}
**Focus**: Development of AI-powered digital twin technology for accelerating clinical trials and improving drug development efficiency
**Website**: https://www.unlearn.ai

## Scientific Background

```yaml
technology_approach: Unlearn uses generative machine learning models, specifically Boltzmann-Encoded Adversarial Machines (BEAM) and Neural Boltzmann Machines, to create disease-specific digital twins. The models are trained on data from 26,000+ participants across multiple historical clinical trials (ADNI, CPAD, NACC, EPAD) to learn patterns of disease progression and treatment response.
digital_twin_concept: Digital twins are AI-generated virtual models of individual patients that predict their future health outcomes under control treatment. These models are trained on historical clinical trial data and can be used to create synthetic control groups, reducing the need for large placebo groups while maintaining statistical power. Each digital twin serves as an individualized comparator, providing an additional layer of evidence for interpreting treatment effects.
regulatory_acceptance:
  fda_guidance: The methodology is FDA guidance compliant
  significance: Regulatory acceptance represents a significant milestone in the adoption of AI-driven methods in drug development
  ema_qualification: The digital twin methodology has received EMA (European Medicines Agency) qualification in 2022
biological_justification_alzheimers:
  disease_progression: "Alzheimer's disease has well-characterized progression patterns that can be learned from large longitudinal datasets. The disease follows predictable trajectories in biomarkers (amyloid-beta, tau) and clinical measures (cognitive decline, functional impairment)."
  early_stage_challenges: "Early-stage Alzheimer's trials face challenges with small sample sizes, high variability, and slow progression. Digital twins help overcome these challenges by providing individualized baselines for comparison."
  individual_variability: While disease progression follows general patterns, individual patients show significant variability based on baseline characteristics, genetics, and comorbidities. Digital twins capture this variability by generating patient-specific predictions.
comparison_with_alternative_methods:
  historical_controls:
  description: Traditional historical controls use aggregate data from past trials, which may not account for individual patient variability
  advantage_of_digital_twins: Digital twins account for individual baseline characteristics, reducing bias from population-level differences
  synthetic_control_arms:
  advantage: Individualized approach captures patient-specific characteristics and provides more accurate baseline predictions
  description: "Unlike traditional synthetic control arms that use aggregate historical data, Unlearn's digital twins create individualized counterfactuals for each patient, providing more precise comparisons"
  placebo_controlled_trials:
  description: Traditional placebo-controlled trials require large control groups to achieve statistical power
  advantage_of_digital_twins: Digital twins can reduce control group sizes by 17-26% while maintaining or improving statistical power, making trials more ethical and efficient
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Successfully developed disease-specific digital twin technology trained on 26,000+ participants
- Received EMA qualification for digital twin methodology, establishing regulatory credibility
- Applied digital twins in real-world Phase 2a Alzheimer's disease trial with remynd
- Demonstrated ability to strengthen confidence in early clinical signals in small, noisy trials
- Raised $65 million in funding across multiple rounds from top-tier investors
- Established partnerships with multiple pharmaceutical companies
- Enabled early-phase signal resolution in neurodegenerative disease trials
- Accelerated translation of geroscience into clinical practice

### Challenges

- Need for large historical datasets (26,000+ participants) to train disease-specific models
- Regulatory acceptance requires extensive validation and qualification processes
- Small, noisy early-phase trials present unique challenges for signal detection
- Disease-specific model development requires significant time and resources
- Integration with existing clinical trial protocols and workflows

### Impact on Field

Unlearn's digital twin technology represents a significant advancement in clinical trial methodology, particularly for aging-related and neurodegenerative diseases. By enabling smaller control groups and better signal detection in early-phase trials, the technology addresses critical bottlenecks in drug development for conditions like Alzheimer's disease. The successful application in a real Phase 2a Alzheimer's trial demonstrates that disease-specific digital twins can have practical impact on live trials, not just retrospective modeling. This accelerates the translation of geroscience into the clinic and reduces trial timelines and failure rates in elderly populations, making it a high-impact technology for defeating aging.

  design: Small Phase 2a trial using digital twins to strengthen confidence in early clinical signals
  status: Ongoing
  partner: remynd
  results:
  impact: Enables early-phase signal resolution and accelerates translation of geroscience into the clinic. Demonstrates practical application of disease-specific digital twins in live trials, not just retrospective modeling.
  summary: Digital twins successfully strengthened confidence in early clinical signals for REM127 in Phase 2a trial. The technology enabled more confident interpretation of biomarker trends and clinical outcomes despite small sample size and short observation period.
  limitations:
  note: Trial results are preliminary and from a small Phase 2a study. Full quantitative results may be disclosed in future publications or regulatory submissions.
