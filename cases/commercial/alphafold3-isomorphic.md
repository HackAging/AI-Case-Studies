  integration: Pairformer provides rich representations that condition the diffusion process, enabling accurate structure generation
  diffusion_component:
  process: Starts with random atomic positions and progressively refines them through multiple diffusion steps to match the predicted structure
  advantage: Allows generation of diverse conformations and handles uncertainty in structure prediction
  description: Diffusion process generates 3D atomic coordinates by iteratively denoising from random initial coordinates
  pairformer_component:

  benchmark_results:
  note: Benchmark results compared to AlphaFold 2 and other methods (RoseTTAFold, etc.) are presented in Nature paper. AlphaFold 3 shows superior performance across most metrics.
  casp16:
