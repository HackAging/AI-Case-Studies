# Generate:Biomedicines

## Description

AI-powered protein design company using machine learning to design biological compounds targeting various diseases. Develops the Generative Biology™ Platform for therapeutic protein development across multiple modalities (antibodies, peptides, enzymes, cytokines). GB-0895, the company's anti-TSLP antibody for asthma, represents the first drug optimized using AI systems to enter Phase 3 clinical trials.

## Mission

To use machine learning and big data to design biological compounds targeting various diseases. Generate:Biomedicines aims to program biology to develop new medicines by using algorithms that learn from all known proteins to encode and apply fundamental principles linking genetic sequences to protein structure and function, enabling the creation of new protein sequences with optimized therapeutic potential.

## Company Information

**Legal Name**: Generate:Biomedicines
**Founded**: 2018
**Industry**: Biotechnology
**Employees**: {"as_of":"2024","current":"Not disclosed"}
**Focus**: Machine learning-powered platform for designing and optimizing proteins with therapeutic applications, focusing on immunology, oncology, and infectious diseases
**Website**: https://www.generatebiomedicines.com
**Parent Company**: Flagship Pioneering

## Scientific Background

```yaml
tslp_explanation:
  what_is_tslp: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a protein produced by epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. It plays an important role in inflammation and immune responses.
  therapeutic_target: By targeting TSLP with an antibody, it is possible to interrupt this inflammatory cycle, reducing inflammation and improving respiratory function in asthma patients.
  production_location: TSLP is produced by epithelial cells lining the respiratory airways
  connection_to_asthma: In some people, TSLP release occurs too actively in response to allergens and viruses. This excessive inflammatory response appears to lead to the development of certain forms of asthma. When TSLP is overproduced, it creates a cycle of inflammation that contributes to asthma symptoms and airway dysfunction.
  role_in_inflammation: TSLP can be released from damaged cells in response to allergens and viruses, triggering an inflammatory response. It acts as a key mediator in the inflammatory cascade.
antibodies_explanation:
  ai_optimization: AI can help design antibodies with improved properties, such as better binding to the target, higher specificity, and longer persistence in the body, making them more effective as therapeutic agents.
  therapeutic_use: In this case, antibodies are used therapeutically not to target pathogens, but to target specific proteins (like TSLP) that contribute to disease. Therapeutic antibodies can block the activity of disease-causing proteins, providing a targeted treatment approach.
  what_are_antibodies: Antibodies are molecules that the immune system uses to recognize and neutralize various pathogens. They are Y-shaped proteins that can bind specifically to target molecules.
```

## Lessons Learned

### Achievements

- Successfully raised $370M in Series B funding (November 2021)
- Established strategic partnership with Amgen ($50M upfront, up to $1.9B total potential)
- Secured investment from Samsung Life Science Fund (December 2024)
- Demonstrated ability to generate therapeutic proteins in less than 3 weeks (SARS-CoV-2 example)
- Recognized as 'Most Innovative Life Sciences Company' at AWS Life Sciences Symposium (2025)
- Built platform trained on 160,000 protein structures and 190 million genetic sequences

### Challenges

- Training machine learning models on massive datasets (160K structures, 190M sequences) requires significant computational resources
- Translating AI-designed proteins from computational models to functional therapeutics
- Balancing speed of generation with therapeutic efficacy and safety
- Scaling platform capabilities across multiple therapeutic modalities

### Impact on Field

Generate:Biomedicines represents a significant advancement in AI-driven protein therapeutics discovery. The Generative Biology™ platform demonstrates the potential to rapidly design therapeutic proteins across multiple modalities (antibodies, peptides, enzymes, cytokines), addressing a key bottleneck in drug discovery. The ability to generate therapeutic proteins in weeks rather than months or years has significant implications for longevity research, as it enables rapid iteration and optimization of protein-based interventions targeting aging mechanisms. The partnership with Amgen and recognition at AWS Symposium validate the platform's potential. The company's approach of learning from all known proteins to encode fundamental principles of protein structure and function represents a paradigm shift toward data-driven, AI-powered therapeutic design.
