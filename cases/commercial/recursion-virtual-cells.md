## Products

### Virtual Cells Framework
**Alternative Names**: Virtual Cells, Recursion Virtual Cells
**Type**: platform
**Status**: in_development
**Development Stage**: Active development - building foundation for first virtual cell
**Role in Project**: primary
**Relationship Description**: Primary product - Virtual Cells Framework is the core computational platform for drug discovery
**Description**: A computational system designed to accurately simulate cellular and patient-level responses to therapeutic interventions. Virtual cells are built on top of Recursion's massive, proprietary biological and chemical datasets, AI models, and one of the industry's most powerful supercomputers, BioHive-2.
**Mechanism of Action**: Virtual cells use deep resources of phenomics, transcriptomics, and other data to train models. Over time, these models are able to simulate the outcomes of phenomic and transcriptomic experiments across relevant cell types. The framework includes an 'explanation' function that provides mechanistic reasoning behind predictions, helping expand understanding of biology and build trust in the model.
**Target**: Cellular and patient-level responses to therapeutic interventions
**Pathway**: Multiple biological pathways and cellular processes
**Capabilities**:
- Accurately simulate phenomics experiments
- Predict outcomes of large-scale drug screening
- Provide mechanistic explanations for predictions
- Create cell-specific virtual maps to quickly surface novel targets and hits
- Reduce uncertainty, costs, long timelines, and 90% failure rates associated with traditional drug discovery
**Applications**:
- Drug discovery and development
- Target identification
- Hit identification and optimization
- Predicting cellular responses to therapeutic interventions
- Understanding biological mechanisms
**Components**:
```yaml
-
  name: MolE
  description: A foundation model for chemistry trained on over 842 million molecular graphs, further fine-tuned on a set of downstream ADMET tasks that can help guide chemical property prediction and the design of highly optimized drug-like molecules
-
  name: Molphenix
  description: A foundation model that can predict the effect of any given molecule and concentration pair on phenotypic cell assays and cell morphology
-
  name: Boltz-2
  description: An open-source model developed in partnership with MIT that predicts both the 3D structure of protein-ligand complexes and their binding affinity—two critical factors in early-stage drug discovery—far more efficiently than traditional physics-based approaches
```
**Technical Details**:
```yaml
type: Computational platform
