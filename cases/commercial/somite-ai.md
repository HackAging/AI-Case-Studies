description: "Somite AI is a biotechnology company pioneering foundation models for human stem cells, harnessing artificial intelligence to revolutionize cell therapy development. Founded in 2023 and beginning operations in January 2024, the company has developed a proprietary capsule-based data generation platform that enables data generation at an unprecedented scale—approximately one-thousandth the cost of traditional methods (1000x more efficiently). This capsule technology generates dense, causal datasets essential for training transformative foundation models by capturing cell-state transitions with unprecedented efficiency. These proprietary datasets are used to train the DeltaStem foundation model, which accelerates the discovery of new cell differentiation protocols and optimizes them for purity, functionality, and scalability. Somite AI aims to transform cell therapy development from a costly, decade-long guessing game into a compute-bound engineering discipline, enabling the creation of a foundry of human spare parts for treating a wide range of diseases including type 1 diabetes, muscular dystrophy, and orthopedic conditions. The company operates through Somite AI (platform development) and Somite Therapeutics (therapeutic development), with their lead therapeutic candidate SMT-M01 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy receiving FDA orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations."
mission: "To build foundation models for the human cell, harnessing AI to usher in a new era of human repair and regenerative medicine, making cell therapy development faster, cheaper, and enabling entirely new therapeutic possibilities."

Strategic investment to significantly increase computational power for training foundation models, enabling enhanced model capabilities and faster development cycles.

## Scientific Publications and Research

**Current Status**: As of the research date, Somite AI has not yet published peer-reviewed scientific publications directly describing their proprietary capsule technology or DeltaStem foundation model. This is typical for early-stage biotechnology companies developing proprietary platforms, as they often maintain confidentiality during development and validation phases.

**Related Research**: The scientific co-founders have extensive publication records in relevant fields:
- **Allon Klein**: Professor at Harvard Medical School, expert in single-cell genomics and systems biology, with numerous publications on cell biology and developmental processes
- **Olivier Pourquie**: Professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, member of National Academies, with extensive publications on developmental biology, somite segmentation, and stem cell biology
- **Jay Shendure**: Professor at University of Washington, HHMI Investigator, with publications on genomics, single-cell biology, and functional genomics
- **Cliff Tabin**: Chair of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, with publications on genetics and developmental biology

**Research Approach**: Somite AI's approach builds on foundational research in:
- Single-cell genomics and transcriptomics
- Developmental biology and cell differentiation
- Foundation models in biology (similar to AlphaFold for protein structure)
- Computational biology and AI applications in life sciences

**Future Publications**: As the company progresses and validates its platform, scientific publications describing the capsule technology, foundation model architecture, and therapeutic applications are expected.

## Partnerships and Collaborations

### Partnership with OmniaBio Inc.

Somite Therapeutics (therapeutic development arm) has partnered with OmniaBio Inc. to advance their cell therapy program for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This partnership combines:
- **Somite's expertise**: AI-driven cell therapy methods and platform technologies
- **OmniaBio's expertise**: Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) manufacturing and cell therapy development

The collaboration focuses on developing SMT-M01, which has received FDA orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations.

### Partnership with AMD Ventures

Strategic partnership announced in August 2025 to:
- Significantly increase computational power for training foundation models using AMD Instinct GPUs
- Optimize software tools for biological data processing
- Develop solutions tailored for next-generation foundation models

This partnership addresses the computational demands of training large-scale foundation models on biological data.

## Vision

Somite AI envisions an "AlphaFold moment for developmental biology," where advancements in AI transform our understanding of cell differentiation from a costly guessing game into a compute-bound engineering discipline. The company's CEO, Dr. Micha Breakstone, describes this as being "on the cusp of a true breakthrough in data generation for cell-state transitions," where the capsule-based platform provides "dense, causal datasets essential for training transformative foundation models."

This approach doesn't just make the development of cell therapies faster and cheaper—it enables entirely new therapeutic possibilities by reliably producing cell types previously beyond reach, opening the door to creating a foundry of human spare parts for treating a wide range of diseases. The vision extends to transforming cell therapy development timelines from decades to compute-bound engineering, potentially benefiting millions of patients with diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to muscular diseases and blood disorders.
